It combines traditional budgeting methods with digital income tracking, cryptocurrency holdings, and data visualization to showcase a broad understanding of personal finance and financial reporting.

> 📊 This dashboard was originally built for personal use but has been adapted with example data to demonstrate core skills in financial analysis, dashboard creation, and data organization.
